# The A to Z Pub Crawl

In 2013 a group of my friends decided to attempt every pub crawls on the [Londonist A to Z list](https://londonist.com/2014/04/whats-the-best-pub-in-zone-1). As the crawls and data started stacking up, I decided to make a little website to track it.

Our current predicted end date is `*1 October 2022*`
